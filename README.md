## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Compile without preview and type-checking for Production

```sh
npm run build-only
```

### Start a local web server that serves the built solution from ./dist for previewing

```sh
npm run preview
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Install [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)

```sh
npm run prepare
```

### Install [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run prepare-test
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run type checking

```sh
npm run type-check
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Format all code in the src/ folder using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

```sh
npm run format
```
